    <p class = "about-p">Hi, Iâ€™m Nico, a graphic <span><a href = "project-menu.html">design</a></span> passionate. I like to play with <span><a href = "space.html">typography</a></span> and shapes to create <span><a href = "logo-botique.html">logos</a></span> and <span><a href = "graphic_images.html">compositions</a></span> that make things cool. This website is more of a way to show some of the things I do and at the same time train my coding skills to learn web-development better. If you want to work with me on a project you can reach me out <span><a href = "contact.html">here</a></span>.</p>
